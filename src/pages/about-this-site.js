    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is about beer, but we can't forget about what drives me to drink in the first place: building websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      I originally built this site as a WordPress blog over on <a href="https://pantheon.io">Pantheon</a>. This latest version still uses the initial
      WordPress install, but the frontend now runs on <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS</a> and pulls data from
      the WordPress site via the WP JSON API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code is hosted on GitHub, and upon a merge to the master branch, we trigger a build over on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud">Gatsby Cloud</a>.
      Once the build completes, it deploys itself up to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>It's a lot of moving parts, but the magic that is Gatsby somehow makes this much easier 
      (and more fun) to work with than vanilla WordPress. Cheers! <span role="img" aria-label="beers emoji">üçª</span></p>
